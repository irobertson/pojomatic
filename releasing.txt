To release:

*) edit pom files to reflect new versions. pojomatic-test-utils should
   go to 1.0 (unless a new version is released), and both children
   should point to the new parent.
*) commit, and tag with pojomatic-all-x.y.z
*) Run maven with jdk 9 or later; it seems the deploy operation for
   pojomatic may need jdk 11 (bugs in 9 and 10)
*) in root:
  *) mvn clean site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm
  *) mvn -N deploy
*) in pojomatic:
  *) mvn clean deploy
*) log into https://oss.sonatype.org/, check the staging repositories,
   and release them
*) edit poms back to snapshot status.
*) push
